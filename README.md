#question 1
a) the graph has 5 verticies
b) 
a->c->b 6*8
a->d->b 11*7
a->e->b 1*11
a->a->b 9*3

# question 2
ram: 4915200 kB 
float = 4 bytes

4915200 / 2 = 2457600
2457600 / 4 = 2457600

therefore the largest N * N float array can be 2457600 * 2457600

# question 3
To do that would be as simple as zeroing out sections that aren't inside the tile range

so tha

# question 4
a)
